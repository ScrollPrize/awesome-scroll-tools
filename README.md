# üìú Awesome Scroll Tools [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

Here are all the awesome awarded open source contributions from our community that will allow us to read the scrolls! üìö‚ú®

We maintain this list [on GitHub](https://github.com/ScrollPrize/awesome-scroll-tools) and it can also be found [on our website](https://scrollprize.org/community_projects).

Contributions are divided into four categories: _Data access/visualization_, _Segmentation_, _Ink Detection_, and _Other_.

Every category is subdivided in classes: üåü _Highlighted_ (for popular contributions), ‚öôÔ∏è _Tools_, üì¶ _Materials_, üìù _Reports_, and üìä _Visualization_.

Some highlighted contributions are added to this repository as submodules.

We keep this repository updated as much as we can, but research moves _fast_! üèÉüí®
